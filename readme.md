### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Backend Developer**

Right now enjoy working with

Currently Learning a few Frontend dev, particularly

Currently working at Surv Technologies as a Backend Dev where we model cutting-edge financial technology solutions for small and medium businesses specifically in  Rural Internet Connectivity(RICs), Loans and the Informal Banking Sector(LIBSes). We also offer Web Hosting solutions and VPS servers in conjunction with our partners from the US and EU. Hit me up if you want to know more.

If am not coding, am either playing with my kid, trying something new or reading a book(Currently reading *[Decolonising The Mind - Ngugi wa Thiongo](https://www.uibk.ac.at/anglistik/staff/davis/decolonising-the-mind.pdf)*). I also love teaching/coaching, so you may find me also on online meetups explaining something to someone, or am listening to someone teaching something.

I am an open book, no new version of me, just an improved one everyday.
